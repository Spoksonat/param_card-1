# Param card

The following website is intended to explain the structure of the param card used to simulate monte carlo events using madgraph, pythia and delphes. This simulation takes into account an standard model extension, known as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). 

The parameters associated with the MSSM are given by:

|  Parameter | Description |

|  Signal  |         0.2        |
| $t\bar{t}$ |        504,4       |
